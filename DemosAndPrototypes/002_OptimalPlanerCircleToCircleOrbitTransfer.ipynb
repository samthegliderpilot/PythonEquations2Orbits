    "# Optimal Planer Circle to Circle Orbit Transfer\n",
    "This problem was recreated from Optimal Control with Aerospace Applications by James M. Longuski, Jose J. Guzman and John E. Prussing.  Thank you all for this (and Jose, sorry for not figuring out accents in Markdown, and we should talk about the difficulties you had in Appendix C.  A rule of thumb that works for pure numerical methods fails for indirect methods and I think that caused problems for you).\n",

    "We are going to solve the optimal continuous thrust transfer between 2 circular orbits in the same orbit plane.  The specifics of the problem are posed as transfer from a low-Earth orbit to a Geo orbit.  We will start with the equations of motion, constants and constraints, and go through deriving the optimal control conditions that we can solve (the indirect method).  Then, we will solve the problem using direct methods leveraging the python library pyomo.\n",
